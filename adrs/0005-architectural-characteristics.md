## Architecture Decision Record: Architectural Characteristics

**Status:** Accepted

### Context

The system being designed is an AI-powered interview scheduling system. This system aims to automate
and streamline the interview process by using AI agents to schedule interviews, gather feedback, and
provide insights.

### Decision

The top 3 driving characteristics for this system are:

* Data Integrity
* Data Consistency
* Interoperability

### Justification

* **Data Integrity:**
    * **Rationale:** The system handles sensitive data, including candidate information, interview
      feedback, and scheduling details. Maintaining data integrity is crucial to ensure the
      accuracy, consistency, and reliability of this information. Corrupted or inaccurate data can
      lead to scheduling errors, miscommunication, and flawed decision-making.
    * **Consequences:**
        * Accurate and reliable data, efficient interview process, compliance with data privacy
          regulations.

* **Data Consistency:**
    * **Rationale:** Given that the system will likely interact with multiple data sources and
      involve distributed components, data consistency is essential. It ensures that all parts of
      the system operate on the same data, preventing discrepancies and conflicts.
    * **Consequences:**
        * Unified view of data, reduced errors, and improved system reliability.

* **Interoperability:**
    * **Rationale:** The system needs to integrate with various external systems such as InterviewLogger,
      Calendar System, and other HR tools. Interoperability ensures that the system can seamlessly
      exchange data and work effectively with these systems.
    * **Consequences:**
        * Seamless integration with existing systems, efficient data exchange, and streamlined
          workflows.
