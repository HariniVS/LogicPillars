# ADR-0004: Vector Database with Embeddings for Profile Matching

* **Status:** Accepted
* **Date:** 2025-03-20
* **Deciders:** [Engineering Team]

## Context

Our application requires an efficient and accurate profile matching system to connect users based on their skills, interests, and other profile attributes. We need a solution that can understand semantic relationships between profile data and provide high-quality matches beyond simple keyword matching.

## Options Considered

* **Vector Database with Embeddings** (Chosen)
* **Elasticsearch or similar full-text search engines**
* **Traditional SQL/NoSQL databases with custom matching algorithms**
* **Graph databases**

## Decision

We have decided to implement a vector database with embeddings for our profile matching process.

## Rationale

### Vector Database with Embeddings

* **Semantic Understanding**: Vector embeddings capture the semantic meaning of text, allowing for matching based on conceptual similarity rather than exact keyword matches.
* **Efficiency**: Vector databases are optimized for similarity search operations, providing fast query performance even with large datasets.
* **Flexibility**: Can handle various data types (text, images, etc.) and can be fine-tuned for domain-specific matching.
* **Scalability**: Modern vector databases are designed to scale horizontally with growing data volumes.
* **Accuracy**: Provides more nuanced matching by understanding context and meaning, reducing false positives and negatives.

### Why Not Elasticsearch or Similar:

* While Elasticsearch offers powerful full-text search capabilities, it primarily relies on lexical matching which may miss semantic connections.
* More complex to configure for semantic search compared to purpose-built vector databases.
* Less efficient for high-dimensional vector operations compared to specialized vector databases.

### Why Not Traditional SQL/NoSQL:

* Lacks built-in semantic understanding capabilities.
* Would require complex custom algorithms for matching that would be difficult to maintain and scale.
* Query performance would degrade with dataset growth and complexity.

### Why Not Graph Databases:

* While excellent for relationship-based queries, they don't inherently understand semantic similarity.
* Would still require additional embedding generation and similarity computation.
* More complex to maintain for our specific use case.

## Consequences

### Pros:
* Higher quality matches based on semantic understanding rather than keyword matching
* Better user experience through more relevant profile recommendations
* Improved scalability for growing user base
* Flexibility to incorporate different types of profile data
* Future-proof solution that can leverage advancements in embedding models

### Cons:
* Requires expertise in machine learning and embedding models
* Additional computational resources for generating and storing embeddings
* Potential cold start issues with new profiles
* Need for periodic retraining of embedding models to maintain relevance
* May require more complex monitoring and maintenance compared to traditional solutions
